# Database Project

This project utilized Node.js and the Express framework to communicate with the backends of both an SQL and MongoDB database. The project employed RESTful CRUD operations to perform various data-related tasks. On the front-end, EJS was utilized to merge HTML and JavaScript code, providing a dynamic and interactive user experience.
